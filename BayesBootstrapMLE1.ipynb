    "    \n",
    "In general I will take three approaches to this two of which are [frequentist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequentist_inference) and one that is [Bayesian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics).  I'll admit now, I am not as familar with Bayesian methods and that's why I'll be sticking to a simple example of estimating the mean rate or $\\lambda$ in a [Poisson distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution#) from sampled data. I don't believe one approach to statistics is inherently better than the other, but have found so-called frequentist for me to be easier to understand, easier to implement and additionally I found Fisherian approaches satisfying from a mathematical point of view.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the technical side, I wanted to do something different decided to write the distribution for generating data in [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/) and use that distribution from Python. But why did I write my distribution in Scala? Well, I like Scala and enjoyed the challenge of writing a Poisson distribution using a functional approach. I also wanted to learn more about how to use [Py4J](https://www.py4j.org/) which can be used to work with functions and objects in the [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) from Python. [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) actually uses Py4J in PySpark to write Python wrappers for Scala code. I've used both PySpark and Spark in Scala and this gave me an opportunity to understand how PySpark works better.\n",

    "## 1. Sampling A Poisson Distribution Written In Scala with Py4J\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing I need is data from a Poisson distribution to estimate the mean rate $\\lambda$ and for that purpose I wrote a [Poisson distribution in Scala](https://github.com/mdh266/PoissonDistributionInScala). The Poisson distribution is a probability distribution for a random variable $y$ that represents some count phenomena, i.e. a number of non-zero integer occurences in some fixed time frame.  For example the number of trains passing through a station per day or the number of customers that visit a website per hour are governed by Poisson distribution. The disibution is,\n",

    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\lambda$ is the rate variable, i.e. the true number of customers that visit the website per hour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step was to create the Poisson class. I did this in a previous [project](https://github.com/mdh266/PoissonDistributionInScala), however, one key difference is the return value of any public value needs to be Java object. Specifically the [sample](https://github.com/mdh266/BayesBootstrapMLE/blob/main/src/main/scala/Poisson.scala) method needs to return a Java List ([java.util.List[Int]](https://www.javatpoint.com/java-list)) of integers. I originally tried returning a [Scala List](https://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/collection/immutable/List.html) which worked fine in pure Scala, but when Py4J was not able to serialize this object so well and Python type of returned list was \"Java Object\".\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is pretty straight forward to from the [Py4J Documentation](https://www.py4j.org/getting_started.html) and is in the [Main.Scala](https://github.com/mdh266/BayesBootstrapMLE/blob/main/src/main/scala/Main.scala) object:\n",

However, the entrypoint doesn't really offer a way for us to pass the $\\lambda$ value from [Python](https://www.py4j.org/getting_started.html#writing-the-python-program) to the Poisson constructor in Scala. To get around this issue I created a [PoissonEntryPoint](https://github.com/mdh266/BayesBootstrapMLE/blob/main/src/main/scala/PoissonEntryPoint.scala) case class:\n",

    "    }\n",
    "\n",
    "This case class really just acts a [Singleton](https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/singleton-objects.html), but is a class instead of an object. The point of the `PoissonEntryPoint` class is simply to be able to create a Poisson class with a specific $\\lambda$ value after starting the GatewayServer.  \n",

I won't go into the details here, but I will say that Maven is a java tool to compile and package our code while [SBT](https://www.scala-sbt.org/) is the Scala equivalent. Since Scala is a [JVM language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages) we can use either, however, I went with Maven since I'm more familiar with it and because examples with Py4J were much more easy to find.\n",
